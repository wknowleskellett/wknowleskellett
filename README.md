- 👋 Hi, I’m William Knowles-Kellett.
- 🎓 I'm looking for work as a Software Engineer.
- 🦀 I'm learning Rust.
- 👀 I’m interested in open source.
- 🤖 I’m currently learning Godot, to make a game inspired by [this comic](https://xkcd.com/2061/).
- 🎮 As an [ObieSource](https://obiesource.github.io/) alumn, I'm still the lead on [The Long Game](https://github.com/ObieSource/The-Long-Game) until I get ousted.
